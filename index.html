    <h2>About Me</h2>
 <p>
    I am a rising fourth year Electrical Engineering student at UCLA. When I first arrived on campus, I had no prior experience in engineering. I did not know how to code, build a circuit, or even read a schematic. But I brought with me a strong work ethic and a deep curiosity. I committed myself to learning by doing — teaching myself how to wire circuits, debug problems, and explore hardware through trial and error. Over time, I built a strong technical foundation and gained experience across circuits, embedded systems, coding, and user-facing projects. What I enjoy most is bringing ideas to life — whether it's soldering by hand or troubleshooting a full prototype, the challenge of making something work excites me.
  </p>

  <p>
    My experiences have been diverse. I have worked on both solo and collaborative efforts, applying myself to a wide range of tools and technologies. I enjoy learning across fields and would love the opportunity to either continue growing broadly or dive deeper into one area. Regardless of the direction, my motivation always comes from a genuine love for building and learning. Outside the lab, I return home to Los Banos where I coach kids in basketball and swimming. Guiding young athletes has shown me how powerful mentorship can be — and how growth, in any form, starts with belief and effort. This same philosophy shapes how I approach engineering and how I hope to support others in the field.
  </p>

  <p>
    I want to make engineering accessible, especially for students who may not have early exposure to it. I am proud of how far I have come — not just in technical skill, but in confidence, communication, and leadership. I believe the best engineers are driven not only by knowledge but by a mindset that embraces uncertainty, creativity, and collaboration. Whether I am mentoring a teammate, building something new, or pushing through a difficult challenge, I carry the same goal: to grow, and help others grow too. I’m excited for what comes next.
  </p>

  <p>
    As I look toward the future, I am seeking an environment where I can continue to work hands-on, learn from experienced engineers, and contribute to meaningful projects that have real-world impact. I value companies that support personal development, encourage collaboration, and challenge their teams to think critically. I am ready to bring my passion, work ethic, and adaptability to the next chapter of my journey — and I am eager to learn from those around me while making a difference.
