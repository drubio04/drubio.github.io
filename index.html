    <h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
Iâ€™m a rising fourth-year Electrical Engineering student at UCLA, and my path into this field didnâ€™t follow a traditional trajectory. When I started college, I didnâ€™t have a single technical skill to my name. I didnâ€™t know how to wire a circuit, write a line of code, or navigate an engineering lab. But what I did have was drive. I was curious, persistent, and completely committed to figuring things out for myself, even if I had to start from zero. That mindset became the foundation for everything that followed. Over time, through late nights, hands-on frustration, and small breakthroughs, I found myself learning skills I never imagined I would. I became comfortable with debugging, design iteration, and the entire process of bringing something from idea to implementation. That feeling of building something real with your hands, of watching a project move from concept to completion, is what made me fall in love with engineering. I started to realize that I wasnâ€™t just completing assignments or passing exams. I was growing into the kind of engineer I had always hoped to becomeâ€”someone who is not only technically capable, but genuinely passionate about the process.
One of the things I value most about my experience so far is how diverse itâ€™s been. Iâ€™ve explored different corners of the engineering world, from hardware-focused circuitry and embedded systems to interface design and applied machine learning. Iâ€™m not afraid to try something new, to pick up a new tool or dive into an unfamiliar concept. That openness has helped me develop a broad skill set and a deep respect for the complexity and beauty of the field. I donâ€™t feel pressure to commit to just one specialty at this point in my journey. I am equally excited by the opportunity to go wide and learn across domains as I am by the idea of going deep and mastering a specific focus. Either direction allows me to do what I love mostâ€”learn, build, and improve. Beyond the technical side, I also care deeply about the human side of engineering. I want to encourage others who feel like outsiders or late starters. I know what it feels like to walk into a lab and feel behind. I know what it feels like to look around and question whether you belong. That perspective is exactly why I believe I can make a difference. I want to help create spaces where people feel welcomed and supported in their growth, regardless of where they start. If I can inspire even one person to keep going when they doubt themselves, that matters to me. 
Everything you see on this site is more than just a summary of my work. Itâ€™s a reflection of who I am, what Iâ€™ve overcome, and what I hope to contribute to this field moving forward. I am constantly learning, improving, and pushing myself further. And I am excited for whatever comes next.
