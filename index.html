      I’m a rising fourth-year Electrical Engineering student at UCLA, and my path into this field didn’t follow a traditional trajectory. When I started college, I didn’t have a single technical skill to my name. I didn’t know how to wire a circuit, write a line of code, or navigate an engineering lab. But what I did have was drive. I was curious, persistent, and completely committed to figuring things out for myself, even if I had to start from zero. That mindset became the foundation for everything that followed.

      Over time, through late nights, hands-on frustration, and small breakthroughs, I found myself learning skills I never imagined I would. I became comfortable with debugging, design iteration, and the entire process of bringing something from idea to implementation. That feeling of building something real with your hands, of watching a project move from concept to completion, is what made me fall in love with engineering.

      One of the things I value most about my experience is how diverse it’s been. I’ve explored many corners of engineering—from embedded systems to user interface design—and I’m open to learning across disciplines or specializing deeply. My love for learning and building is what drives me, no matter the path.

      More than anything, I want to show others that you don’t need to be a genius or prodigy to become an engineer. You just have to start, stay curious, and keep pushing. I’m here because I refused to quit. And I want others to know they can do the same.
