    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a rising fourth year Electrical Engineering student at UCLA. When I first arrived on campus, I had absolutely no prior experience in engineering. I did not know how to code, build a circuit, or even read a schematic. But I came in with a strong work ethic and a willingness to learn. That mindset shaped everything I have accomplished since. 

      I committed myself to learning by doing. I have spent hours exploring hardware, teaching myself how to build things from the ground up, and asking questions whenever I hit a wall. Over time, I picked up new skills across many areas—from circuits and embedded systems to digital tools and prototyping methods. 

      What I love most is the process of creating something real. Being able to work hands-on, to wire something together and see it function, is incredibly fulfilling to me. Every late-night debugging session, every trial and error moment, helped shape me into someone who does not just understand theory, but knows how to build and improve real systems. 

      I see myself as a learner who is passionate about a wide range of fields. I have experience in various branches of engineering and technology, and I hope to grow even further—either by expanding into new areas or by diving deeper into one specialization. My curiosity keeps me moving forward, and I enjoy working on problems that challenge me to think creatively and push my limits. 

      Beyond engineering, I have found another passion that means a lot to me: giving back. When I return home to Los Banos, I spend time coaching kids in both basketball and swimming. Working with young athletes reminds me of the importance of mentorship and personal growth. Whether I am teaching a kid how to improve their jump shot or helping someone swim with confidence for the first time, I try to create moments that encourage belief in oneself. 

      That spirit of coaching carries over into how I view engineering. I do not just want to build for the sake of building—I want to use what I have learned to inspire others. I believe engineering should be something anyone can pursue, regardless of where they start. I want to help make the field more approachable and inclusive for future generations. 

      Being around young learners shows me just how powerful it is to have someone who believes in you. That is the kind of teammate and engineer I strive to be. Whether I am leading a technical effort or supporting others on a team, I focus on growing together. I believe that environments built on patience, collaboration, and shared goals lead to the best innovations. 

      I am proud of how far I have come, but I know there is still much more to learn. I wake up every day excited to improve my skills, to meet new challenges, and to work with people who care as deeply about engineering as I do. I believe the best engineers are not just those with technical knowledge, but those who bring passion, humility, and drive into everything they create. 

      My journey so far has been one of growth and perseverance, and I am just getting started. Whether it is in a lab, at a chalkboard, or out on the court mentoring kids, I find purpose in helping others grow and continuing to grow alongside them.
