    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
I’m a rising 4th year Electrical Engineering student at UCLA, and if there’s one thing I’ve learned since starting this journey, it’s that you don’t need to know everything from day one — you just need to be willing to learn. I came into college with no technical background at all. I wasn’t the kid who built robots in high school or entered college already fluent in code. I started from scratch — and honestly, I’m proud of that.

What I lacked in experience, I made up for in commitment. Over time, I taught myself how to work with circuits, how to program, how to debug systems that didn’t want to cooperate, and how to bring ideas to life with my own hands. The deeper I went, the more I realized I wasn’t just checking boxes for a degree — I genuinely loved this work. There’s something about building something real, something physical, and watching it come to life that hits differently. That’s what keeps me going.

My experience so far has been diverse. I’ve touched everything from embedded systems to user interface design, hardware debugging to software modeling. I wouldn’t say I’m locked into one specialty just yet — and to be honest, I don’t want to be. I’m passionate about the entire process of engineering, whether that means going broad and learning as much as I can across disciplines, or going deep and becoming an expert in a specific area. Either path is exciting to me. My love for learning and building is what drives me forward.

Beyond the technical side, I care deeply about making this field more accessible. I want younger students — especially those who don’t think they “look like engineers” or feel behind — to know that starting from zero is more than okay. It’s powerful. I’ve lived it, and I’m still living it. Now, I want to inspire others to step in and do the same.

Everything I’ve built, learned, and explored up to this point is just the beginning. I’m excited for what’s next — the challenges, the breakthroughs, the late nights, the deep dives. I’m here for all of it.
